# Randevu Sistemi — Appointment Management System

A full-featured, modern appointment scheduling and management system built with PHP, MySQL, and TailwindCSS. Designed for XAMPP environments with enterprise-grade security, multi-branch support, customer loyalty, and a comprehensive admin panel.

## Features

### Appointment Management
- Online booking with real-time availability
- Recurring appointments (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Multi-branch support with per-branch services, employees, and schedules
- Break time management with employee overrides
- QR code check-in system
- Appointment history with cancel/reschedule tokens

### Customer Experience
- Loyalty points (1 point per 50 TL spent)
- Token-based appointment management (cancel, reschedule, payment)
- Email & SMS notifications (PHPMailer, SmsService)
- Post-appointment mood tracking (emoji-based review)
- Customer-facing package purchase and usage
- PWA support (offline-capable service worker + manifest)

### Admin Panel
- Standalone page architecture (no routed SPA)
- Dashboard with statistics, mood chart (Chart.js), and appointment heatmap
- Full CRUD: services, employees, customers, branches, working hours, break times
- Package management with multi-service session bundles
- Bulk messaging to customers
- Settings panel with 8 sub-tab categories (general, SMTP, SMS, payment, API, backup, cache, error handling)
- API test console with auto-generated code examples (cURL, PHP, JS, Python)
- Review management filtered by mood score

### Security
- CSRF protection (per-session tokens + double-submit cookie pattern)
- Rate limiting (30 req/min per IP + endpoint)
- Brute force lockout (5 failed attempts → 1-hour IP block)
- Honeypot fields on public forms
- Input sanitization (strip tags, trim, type casting)
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Session IP & user-agent binding
- IP blocking system (manual + automatic)
- SQL injection prevention (prepared statements throughout)
- Activity logging for security events

### REST API
- Bearer token authentication (Authorization header only)
- Full CRUD for appointments, services, employees, customers
- Pagination, filtering, sorting
- Rate limiting & brute force protection
- Input validation with descriptive errors
- Security headers on all responses

### Technical Features
- **Settings stored in database** — fully editable from admin UI
- **Multi-language** — Turkish (native) + English via `_t()` helper
- **PDF generation** — FPDF with Turkish character transliteration
- **Daily backup** — automatic `mysqldump` with admin controls
- **Cache abstraction** — auto-detects Redis → Memcache → File
- **Error handling** — custom handler with file log + optional Sentry
- **Auto-migration** — database tables and columns created on first load

## Requirements

- XAMPP (Apache + PHP 8.0+ + MySQL 5.7+)
- `mysqldump` in PATH (for backups)
- Optional: Redis or Memcache server

## Installation

1. Clone or copy the project to `C:\xampp\htdocs\randv`
2. Open `http://localhost/randv/` in your browser
3. The database and tables are created automatically on first load
4. Default admin credentials: `admin` / `admin123`

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through the admin panel under **Settings** (8 sub-tabs):

| Tab | Key Settings |
|-----|-------------|
| General | Site name, timezone, date format, appointment duration |
| SMTP | Mail server, port, credentials, encryption |
| SMS | SMS provider, API key, sender name |
| Payment | Iyzico sandbox/live API credentials |
| API | Bearer token for REST API access |
| Backup | Auto-backup toggle, frequency, retention, path |
| Cache | Cache driver (auto/redis/memcache/file), TTL |
| Error | Error log level, Sentry DSN |
